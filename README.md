Thank you to everyone who has helped so far. Both moral and financial support are very important during these critical times. But the true face of this event has not yet been revealed. We will realize the real problems when we remember that the survivors must survive. This disaster destroyed thousands of dreams, but our support must be continuous, not instant, so that the dreams of millions who survived it do not disappear. As developers, we have to do what we can. We beg to all developers in the world. We are not asking you to donate money, we are not asking you to send items, we are just asking you to do what you do best. This time don't code for money, don't code for reputation. Code for the millions in the cold, code for the children in the dark, code for the survivors in despair, code with us, code for them. Just make a project, it doesn't have to be groundbreaking, it doesn't have to be a world-changing project because they don't have a world anymore, just help them survive.
